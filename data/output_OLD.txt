a2ac5: Hi! I'd like to buy the OOB license für my server board, but in the checkout process I can only enter a US invoice address. How can I enter an international address? (I am located in Austria/Europe)
b4279: Unfortunately, our OOB license is only available for US-based customers (US billing address) to purchase at this time. Please check with our resellers and distributors for availability.

https://www.supermicro.com/en/wheretobuy

And have a nice day,
Bernhard
b4279: No problem Bernhard! Thank you, and you as well!
a2ac5: Hello. How may I help you? Hi Joe Hope you are doing well I currently have a supermicro blade enclosure with 4 power supplies. One has failed and I am looking to buy a replacement This is the model
https://store.supermicro.com/2000w-blade-pws-2k01a-br.html I see that it is out of stock Is there any possibility of restocking that item or any way I can purchase it from supermicro?
b4279: Please give me a moment while I check for you. 
a2ac5: Sure, thank you
b4279: This item is running low but I can check to see if we can transfer one for your to purchase Can I email you after checking internally ? Is domenic.r@setplex.com the best email to reach you ?
a2ac5: Okay that'd be great thank you. Yes that email is best
b4279: You're welcome.  Can I help you with anything else? 
a2ac5: Nope, just looking to purchase this one item
b4279: Got it. Will you update with you via email. It was nice talking to you. Have a great day, goodbye! 
a2ac5: Thanks you too! Hello. How may I help you? Hi I am looking for storage solution for our office. Can you give me an advice on that?
b4279: Hi Eugene Sure How many drives were you planning to have? What form factor chassis/case did you want? Do you have an eStore account with us already so that you can browse our selection?
a2ac5: I am thinking about up to 24 hot swapable 3.5" SATA drives, with 2x2.5" SSDs
b4279: Oh ok, thanks! We may have a server that has those specs. Meanwhile, can you create an account so that I can provide you access? https://store.supermicro.com/customer/account/create/
a2ac5: will do just created an account
b4279: Ok thanks with this email address? eugenek@safeai.ai
a2ac5: yes
b4279: Ok found it, took awhile to refresh. You should have access now. Please log into your account to view the Servers tab So I was checking what we can offer and I'm sorry, the 24 Hot-swappable drives were for 2.5" ones. The closest server that we can offer is a 45 drive bay. 
a2ac5: another option would be 24 3.5" drives with expansion later
b4279: The only 24 drive bay options we currently have are for 2.5" drives. T

he 12 drive bay option is what we can only offer for 3.5", then it jumps to 45 unfortunately.  Let me check if we have any upcoming ones though down the road
a2ac5: can you send me the spec for 45 drives?
b4279: Sure Our SSG-6049P-E1CR45H does support up to 45 3.5" or 2.5" drives, 12 just need to be occupied at the minimum.  https://store.supermicro.com/supermicro-4u-superstorage-server-ssg-6049p-e1cr45h.html it has 2 x rear drive slots for SSD as well Also 6 internal drives as well Do you plan on using up to 24+ drives? This would be ideal for future expansion in this case
a2ac5: Let me check
b4279: Ok  The 6 internal drives are for NVMe btw and non-hot swappable
a2ac5: How you swap the drives? Do you need to remove the cover ?
b4279: For the 45 drives, they are hot-swappable from the top. The internal NVMe drives, you will have to though
a2ac5: Another question. Will it support  JBOD configuration?
b4279: Let me check on that
a2ac5: also, does it come with OS?
b4279: Windows Server 2019 can be added. For other OS, you will have to install yourself. 
a2ac5: I am thinking on TrueNAS on BSD
b4279: This doesn't look to have JBOD capabilities unfortunately. 
a2ac5: Any other JBOD capable models?
b4279: Not sold from the eStore. You'd have to check with our Sales team on those options.  https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/chassis?pro=filter%3Dfeature%26feature%3DJBOD Sales-USA@supermicro.com The servers we carry on the eStore don't have the expander backplanes needed for JBOD functionality Well the 45-bay and 60-bay do but internally for the amount of drives they support within themselves
a2ac5: Great! Thank you very much. I'll try to reach sales dept.
b4279: Sounds good, you're welcome!  If you have any other questions, let me know. 
a2ac5: this server looks promising:
https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/chassis?pro=filter%3Dfeature%26feature%3DJBOD
b4279: Which model? It took me to the general page showing all of them
a2ac5: SuperChassis 946LE1C-R1K66JBOD Can you quote it?
b4279: I can't from our end since we don't offer this particular one on the eStore. Please check with our Sales team on this. 
a2ac5: Got it.👍
b4279: Np! Can I help you with anything else?  We haven't heard from you in awhile so this chat will be closed in approximately two minutes. We want to make sure we get your questions taken care of so if you need any further assistance, you can reach us here again or email    It was nice talking to you. Have a great day, goodbye! 
a2ac5: Hello. How may I help you?
b4279: Hi Michael
a2ac5: Di you ship to Australia?
b4279: I'm sorry, but unfortunately, our Supermicro eStore currently only ships within the United States. Please check with our resellers and distributors for availability.
https://www.supermicro.com/en/wheretobuy 
a2ac5: OK thanks
b4279: You're welcome. Is there anything else I may help you with today? 
a2ac5: Not today. Only suggest that the US shipping policy only changeds to International as well.
b4279: I will pass your suggestion  Thank you. It was nice talking to you. Have a great day, goodbye! 
a2ac5: thanks, by Hello. How may I help you?
b4279: Hi Valeriu!
a2ac5: hello Jim
b4279: How can I help you?
a2ac5: I have a motherboard  X9DRi-LN4F+ 2 processor - E5 2679v2 I can't find a memory for her ??
b4279: What capacity memory are you looking for? And what speed?
a2ac5: 32 Gb  - LRDIMM !
b4279: OK, please give me one moment to check. It looks like there's only 1 32GB LRDIMM that's been validated for your motherboard:

MEM-DR332L-SL05-LR16 It's a 32GB DDR3-1600 4Rx4 LP ECC LR DIMM You will have to check with our resellers for availability since we don't carry it on our eStore.

https://www.supermicro.com/en/wheretobuy
a2ac5: Such memory can be filled in all 24 slots ??
b4279: Yes, you should be able to fill all 24 slots with this memory. Is there anything else I may help you with today? 
a2ac5: That is, it works in rank 4 !! ???
b4279: Yes, this is a rank 4 DIMM
a2ac5: But there is one that works in Octal ???
b4279: I'm not sure what you mean?
a2ac5: What can you say about her ??
b4279: Are you asking about other LRDIMMs with lower rank? I'm not understanding your question, sorry
a2ac5: I also do not understand the drawing from the document  !
b4279: What document are you referring to?
a2ac5: https://www.supermicro.com/support/resources/memory/X9_DP_memory_config.pdf E5-2600 v2 (Ivy Bridge)
Socket R Memory Configuration !!!
b4279: So from my understanding, each CPU can support 12 quad rank DIMMs. Since you're using 2 CPUs, you can support 24 total, which is all of the slots on the motherboard
a2ac5: Ranks per DIMM  - Octal & Quad  = Maximum LRDIMMs per
CPU  12
b4279: Right, so each CPU supports 12 total DIMMs, and with 2 CPUs in your system you can support a total of either 24 octal or quad rank DIMMs
a2ac5: is everything  right ?? but is it one and the same memory - or is it different ??
b4279: We don't recommend mixing and matching memory so you'll have to use the same one. So all 24 would have to be quad rank or all 24 would have to be octal rank In this case, if you're going with MEM-DR332L-SL05-LR16, all 24 should be MEM-DR332L-SL05-LR16.
a2ac5: OK, thanks - Jim !!!
b4279: No problem Valeriu! Is there anything else I may help you with today? 
a2ac5: No, thank you very much !!
b4279: It was nice talking to you. Have a great day, goodbye! 
a2ac5: 👌 Hello. How may I help you? Hello, I currently have a 846BA-R920B with the redundant 920W PSUs and I was wondering if a higher wattage PSU is compatible with it and the current power distributor.
b4279: Hi Chandler I can check, please give me a moment
a2ac5: Thank you
b4279: How much higher wattage are you looking for?
a2ac5: Probably around 1280W.
b4279: Ok thanks PWS-1K21P-1R is the closest one, but we are currently out of stock. The next one up is 1400W https://store.supermicro.com/1200w-1u-pws-1k21p-1r.html The 1400W option is also out of stock unfortunately.  PSU shortages unfortunately
a2ac5: Ok, do either of these come in the quiet version as well or is that not an option on these? And that's okay, planning for an upgrade and not in a rush.
b4279: There's PWS-1K41P-SQ, but it looks to be EOL (end of life)  so it doesn't look like there is a SQ version with higher wattage that is compatible unless you search for that 1400W version from our resellers/distributors PWS-1K28P-SQ may also work actually, it wasn't listed for me Also out of stock, but you can search for that too 
a2ac5: Perfect, thank you for the part numbers!
b4279: You're welcome! You're best option looks to be the 1280W one followed by the 1400W for the SuperQuiet versions Can I help you with anything else? 
a2ac5: That's everything, thanks!
b4279: Np! It was nice talking to you. Have a great day, goodbye! 
a2ac5: Hello. How may I help you? Hi, do you have fan : 0126L4 in stock?
b4279: Hi Abdur! May I know where you are located?
a2ac5: Toronto, Canada
b4279: I'm sorry, but unfortunately, our Supermicro eStore currently only ships within the United States. Please check with our resellers and distributors for availability.

https://www.supermicro.com/en/wheretobuy 
a2ac5: Thanks
b4279: You're welcome.  Can I help you with anything else? 
a2ac5: No , thanks. I will check first this fan and will jump to next fan later on
b4279: You're welcome.  I see. It was nice talking to you. Have a great day, goodbye! 
a2ac5: Bye Hello. How may I help you? Hi there! I ordered something yesterday around 1pm central time and paid for overnight shipping. I see it's status is still at 2, 'In Warehouse'.
b4279: Hi Gabriel The system is still being built. Once it is built within the next day or 2, it will ship out with overnight shipping. You will get a shipping confirmation once it has ship.  
a2ac5: Mmmm... This is unclear.  A the top of the item, it says "Ships within 3-5 business days" and "In Stock".

On the shipping methods page, it has 'Standard (3~5 business days)' and then 'Overnight (Next business day)'.

No where on here does it indicate that there are additional days for assembly. The closest thing is the "All Supermicro desktop/workstation systems sold in the North America are assembled and tested at our production facilities in San Jose, CA Headquarters."

But this still doesn't clarify that
b4279: Yeah understandable, I apologize for the confusion.  Yeah it typically takes 1-2 business days for assembly. 
a2ac5: The issue is I will be out of town when it is delivered now.  I'll see if I can figure something out with a friend, but I wish I knew this ahead of time so there's not a desktop sitting in front of my door for 2 days. I know that isn't your fault though.
b4279: Oh no, that's unfortunate. Hopefully that's not the case, or your friend can accommodate for your delivery. 
a2ac5: Could you pass my complaint along to someone who can clarify this for future purchasers?
Just a "Takes 1-2 days to build in addition to shipping time" on the product page and/or shipping page?
b4279: Yeah I just passed my concern to management as well.  on this very line
a2ac5: Thank you!
b4279: You're welcome
a2ac5: Do you happen to know if the packages are usually delivered in the morning or evening for next day delivery, or does that just vary a lot?

To try to coordinate with a friend to grab it.
b4279: For overnight delivery, it can vary so I'd recommend checking what's on the FedEx site. 

If it was priority overnight, it would deliver by 10:30AM local time.  They usually deliver morning/noonish from my experience but it can vary depending on your area. 
a2ac5: Oof.. they'll all be at work, but hopefully it works out! At least it's not for the whole weekend.

Anyway, I appreciate that help, Kyle!  I'm optimistic it won't be an issue!
b4279: NP, of course and I sure hope its not an issue! Again, I apologize for the confusion and hope we can get this wording updated on our end. 
a2ac5: Thanks, Kyle!  Have a good day, sir!
b4279: Thank you! It was nice talking to you. Have a good day as well, goodbye! 
a2ac5: Hello. How may I help you?
b4279: Hi Steve!
a2ac5: Hello Liz! I'm looking for a way to convert this chassis into a low profile rear breakout. I know this item I'm looking for is not to be found in your eStore. But I'd like to see if this is possible?
b4279: Please give me a moment while I check for you.  Can you please explain a little bit for the low profile rear breakout?
a2ac5: This would be the entire rear bracket, which would convert from 802WB to 802LPB style bracket. The bracket is removeable on the CSE-825MBTQC-R802WB, and does seem to be exactly compatible with the LPB bracket provided in model # CSE-825MBTQ-R802LPB.
b4279: I see. I could check internally for this. Can I email you back via email swilliams@nverzion.com? Thank you for your information
a2ac5: Yes, absolutely. Thank you Liz!
b4279: You're welcome. 
a2ac5: If this is possible, I would likely need ten of these brackets total.
b4279: Sound good! I will email you back as soon as I can. Is there anything else I may help you with today? 
a2ac5: That is all for now!
b4279: It was nice talking to you. Have a great day, goodbye!

b4279: Thanks

b4279: Hi Sarah. I'll have to check on our inventory since we're currently out of stock
a2ac5: I did place two orders and one was schedule to arrive yesterday and didn't show and the other is scheduled to arrive on Monday. I am just trying to locate one for testing.
b4279: Ahh OK. I can definitely transfer an additional unit over so you can purchase, but the window for the transfer + purchase + shipping cut off might be pretty tight since our shipping cut off is 3:30 PM. As long as the transfer and order is placed before that, it should arrive tomorrow if you choose overnight shipping.
a2ac5: Do you know how many you can transfer for purchase?
b4279: How many did you need for tomorrow?
a2ac5: I really need one by tomorrow.
b4279: We can definitely do one.
a2ac5: do you have an additional 30 that can be transferred in addition to the one. There would be no rush for the additional 30
b4279: Yes, we should also be able to accommodate that. I'll put the transfer request in now and follow up with you via email once it's completed.
a2ac5: Great, thank you so much.

The original PSU is PWS-706P-1R which is not available the recommended one it looks like is PWS-860P-1R2. Is that correct? and if replacing only 1 PSU with the newer model(PWS-860P-1R2) is that going to work? Or do both PSU's need to be replaced to the new model?

a2ac5: Hello. How may I help you?
b4279: Hi Gijs!
a2ac5: I am wondering where I can purchase aan OOB licence. I am in the Netherlands, Europe, but in my SuperMicro account I can only enter a US address. Consequently my credit card payment does not follow through.
b4279: I see We do carry OOB but we only can sell to US customers since our system rejects non-US credit card payments Do you have an US credit card ( tied to a US billing address)?
a2ac5: Do you happen to know a non US SuperMicro web-site where it can be done?
b4279: We don't have that unfortunately. You can always purchase OOB through resellers though.   Please check with our resellers and distributors for availability.
https://www.supermicro.com/en/wheretobuy

a2ac5: John Delaney left the following comment: quick and very helpful Hello. How may I help you? I have a x9scm-f Rev 1.1 motherboard.   The chipset fan is making a noise.  I'm afraid it will stop and overheat.  Where can I purchase a new fan?
b4279: Hi Stephen! Would you happen to know your chassis SKU? Our fans are generally recommended based off chassis compatibility 
a2ac5: Where would that be located
b4279: You can refer to our serial number guide here to locate a serial number:

https://www.supermicro.com/en/support/rma/sn
a2ac5: OK i'll go look hang on
b4279: OK, thank you Stephen
a2ac5: Ok I'm back the serial number is  zm19u37579
b4279: Thanks Stephen. Give me one moment to look this number up
a2ac5: there is a long number under a barcode if you need it
b4279: It looks like this is the serial number for the motherboard and I couldn't find a chassis associated to it. Is this motherboard housed in a supermicro chassis?
a2ac5: there is also a IPMI number I'm not sure, that is what the sticker said stuck on the motherboard
b4279: OK, lets try something else. Does your chassis look like any one of these 3 below?

https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/chassis/1U/113/SC113MTQ-330CB

https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/chassis/1U/512/SC512F-350B

https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/chassis/1U/813/SC813MTQ-350CB
a2ac5: No   It is a separate motherboard we purchased from newegg and we installed it into a tower.
b4279: Ahh OK
a2ac5: The mother board is stamped  "Super X9SCM-F"
b4279: Right, but even knowing the motherboard model, we wouldn't want to recommend a fan that wouldn't fit into your chassis. That's why we generally need to know the chassis make/model as well
a2ac5: What do you mean by chassis
b4279: The chipset fan you're looking for, is it for an active heatsink? or just a standard 40mm chassis fan the tower/barebone enclosure
a2ac5: It clipped directly onto the mother chipset I think it was like that when be bought the motherboard It has a little bar that fits across it and holds it down I notice online that the revision 1.2 does not have a fan. It just has a heatsink
b4279: Yea, I think that might be why I'm having trouble locating a part number for this fan
a2ac5: It might be too old
b4279: It might be best for you to check with our technical support team. They might be able to help you out.

b4279: We don't carry this particular workstation as the closest one we have is SYS-740A-T, which has X12DAI-N6 installed.  https://store.supermicro.com/sys-740a-t.html
a2ac5: What is the price of that one?
b4279: At lowest cost, it would be around $3,900 before tax. Shipping would be free with standard ground shipping, otherwise, anything faster would also cost extra
a2ac5: I don't pay tax because it is for resale
b4279: If you have tax exempt, we'd refund you the tax you paid on it as well in that case
a2ac5: Do you have it in stock for immediate delivery?
b4279: We do have it in stock, ready to be configured, and ship out 1-2 business days after it has been built. 
a2ac5: what is mandatory to have in it, just the minimum?
b4279: So if you purchase it, it will take 1-2 business days to assembly build, then it would ship out.  let me check That's the minimum, 2 CPUs, 2 memory, 1 2TB HDD We also have this new AMD workstation available as well: https://store.supermicro.com/supermicro-threadripper-performance-workstation-as-5014a-tt.html Starting today

b4279: I see. Please give me a moment while I check for you.  Unfortunately, we don't have the part number for those square notches. You can try contact the RMA department to see if they sell that part

b4279: Hi Lyndell!
a2ac5: Hello I'm trying to get details on the add on network cards for the SYS-5019P-M system In the configurator, it simply says 10G 2xRJ45 Ethernet Adapter I'd like to know the specifics of that adapter, and if that doesn't fit the needs, how would I determine a compatable SuperMicro adapter to go with that server
b4279: What do you need as a network card?
a2ac5: I'm looking for the capabilities of the card, what controller it's using.  I'm interested in cards that support SR-IOV, among other capabilities
b4279: It uses Intel X550-AT2 Here is the link to the card https://www.supermicro.com/wdl/Networking_Drivers/CDR-NIC_1.62_for_Add-on_NIC_Cards/MANUALS/datasheet-AOC-STGS-i2T-i1T.pdf
a2ac5: Ok, so we are saying the add-on card to the SYS-5019P-M SuperServer is the AOC-STGS-i2T/i1T correct?
b4279: It is AOC-STGS-i2T, yes
a2ac5: If so I believe that will meet the needs, I'll need to do some further confirmation but at least I have something to research now Perfect, that's all I needed to know
b4279: Sounds good

a2ac5: Bye Hello. How may I help you? Looking to see what SuperMicro has for 1u servers with NVMe storage.
b4279: Hi Stanley! These servers would most likely be your best option:

https://store.supermicro.com/ultra-server-1u-sys-1029u-tn10rt.html

https://store.supermicro.com/ultra-server-1u-sys-1029u-tr4.html

https://store.supermicro.com/sys-120u-tnr.html I believe the only model we have readily in stock is the 1029U-TR4 There's this one as well.

https://store.supermicro.com/sys-120c-tn10r.html It's a good mix of price + performance. The Ultra servers I provided above are pricier compared to the 120C-TN10R
a2ac5: looking at what you sent Under storage for the sys-1029u-tr4, it has storage 1TB M.2 XG6 NVMe Solid State Drive  is this a true NVMe and just in the m.2 format?
b4279: Please give me a moment while I check for you.  Please bear with me for a few more minutes while I check for you.  Yes, it's an NVMe in M.2 format Although the 1029U-TR4 isn't really optimized for NVMe now that I'm reviewing the configuration. You would only be able to add up to 3 of those drives The 120C-TN10R is one of our newer gen servers and it's optimized for up to 8 NVMe drives
a2ac5: great fun with the configurator.  all the NVMe drives on the 120c-tn10r are out of stock.  hard to get prices that way.
b4279: Let me check on that real quick. Which drive were you trying to select?
a2ac5: I tried all of them under NVMe  there were ones under m.2 that were available
b4279: Ahh OK. I think I see the issue. The required cable for these drives is out of stock, but we've just updated the inventory internally. It might take a few minutes before that gets reflected on our website though If there's a specific drive you're interested in, I can double check on the inventory for that while we wait for our system to update?
a2ac5: lets just check for the 1.92TB 2.5" CM6 NVMe PCIe 4.0 Solid State Drive (1 x DWPD).  In the 960GB 2.5" CD6-R NVMe PCIe 4.0 Solid State Drive (1 DWPD) what does the -R mean?
b4279: OK, I'll check the 1.92 TB CM6.

For the -R, I believe that's something designated by the manufacturer (Kioxia), so I'm actually not sure, but speedwise the CM6 is much faster than CD6. We have enough in stock for the 1.92TB CM6 
a2ac5: I missed the CD6 vs CM6  I thought they were both CM6 and that the -R was read optimized.
b4279: Ahh OK Could you do a hard refresh of your browser (hold CTRL+F5)? You should be able to select that drive now.
a2ac5: What is the price of the 1.92Nvme drives?
b4279: Looks to be $535 per drive
a2ac5: That worked.  Thank you.
b4279: No problem!
a2ac5: What is the Rackmount Keyboard and Mouse Combo and I assume all servers come with rackmounts
b4279: It's just a keyboard and mouse combo that's included with our servers. Unfortunately, the mouse isn't pictured, but that's what the keyboard would look like Actually, I stand correct. The mouse is built in as a touchpad.
a2ac5: looks like a trackpad at the bottom
b4279: My mistake You should be able to configure this system now and the pricing reflected should be accurate If you configure something that you like, I should note that we can build and ship this system within 2-5 business days.
a2ac5: Sounds fine.  Still trying to find out requirements from my customer on drive space needed.    Thank you for the help.
b4279: No problem at all! Can I help you with anything else? 
a2ac5: Can I have the cart sent to me or saved somehow?
b4279: Yea, access your cart again in the top right and on that screen, there's a Save Quote option that will save it as a PDF
a2ac5: Thanks again.
b4279: No problem! https://store.supermicro.com/checkout/cart/ Is there anything else I may help you with today? 
a2ac5: Nothing else now.  Comparing vendors is like comparing apples to oranges.  Can be difficult.

b4279: May I know what parts are those? Which servers are those also please?
a2ac5: SYS-2029U-TN24R4T It doesn't tell me which components are out of stock for my desired conf configuration
b4279: How many SYS-2029U-TN24R4T are you looking for ?
a2ac5: 1
b4279: Can you screen shot the message?
a2ac5: and 2 SYS-6019U-TR4 yeah, one sec
b4279: Please give me a moment while I check for you. 
a2ac5: thank you
b4279: Was it a pre-config link ?
a2ac5: it was a build I created for both
b4279: When I tried to add 16 GB memory following your config, the 16 GB doesn't show on the list.  https://store.supermicro.com/ultra-server-1u-sys-6019u-tr4.html?queryID=184e2d240397d2ce438b85ac587f3a01&objectID=2634&indexName=supermicro_default_products
a2ac5: It looks like the 16GB of ram isn't available anymore along with the 3.2TB NVMe drives
b4279: Yeah, we might have had changed some options under memory Do you want to stick to your configuration ? I can see if I can make the pre-config links for you in this case
a2ac5: I would prefer my configs, but if you can't match them 100%, I would prefer something comparable for the same price, ie 12x16GB RAM 192GB total, or 24x8GB RAM for 192GB total
b4279: Got it ! So 2 pcs SYS-6019U-TR4 and 1 pc SYS-2029U-TN24R4T. Correct?
a2ac5: switching to 8GB sticks kinda screws me for the future upgrades though
b4279: Yeah I get what you mean
a2ac5: yes
b4279: Let me work on the pre-config following your preferred config and go from there
a2ac5: Thank you
b4279: Can I email you via slewis@bitdefender.com?
a2ac5: yes
b4279: Thanks! I will email you as soon as I can Can I help you with anything else? 
a2ac5: Do you have pricing info for the onsite service stuff?
b4279: No, unfortunately eStore doesn't have onsite service available and we wouldn't know the pricing either  
a2ac5: Ok, that's fine. I sent an email asking for more info from them and never heard back.
b4279: Who did you email ?
a2ac5: onsiteservice@supermicro.com
b4279: I see. I can email them as well. Hope that will help.
a2ac5: Thank you

b4279: You're welcome.  It was nice talking to you. Have a great day, goodbye! 
a2ac5: Hello. How may I help you? Is it possible to get a replacement bracket for the 2U cable management arm that connects to a 836 chassis? We have the arm and the chassis side bracket for a different chassis.
b4279: Hi Zack So like one of the brackets included in our cable arm management?
a2ac5: Yeah, I think the original installer threw it away, and we're reusing the arm after upgrading a server.
b4279: Oh I see, that's unfortunate.  Unfortunately, we only sell as a complete cable management kit. You may have to check with our RMA team at rma@supermicro.com if they have any spare ones that can sell or provide. 

Otherwise, you may have to purchase the whole kit again. 
a2ac5: I'll keep looking around for it and if I don't find it soon I'll reach out to the RMA team. Thank you
b4279: Ok sounds good. Let me check for an actual part for the brackets just in case Was it for MCP-290-00073-0N? that's the cable arm you were looking at?
a2ac5: Yeah
b4279: Ok give me a moment It doesn't look like there are any separate parts for the components. Sorry about that part# I meant
a2ac5: Thanks for checking!
b4279: You're welcome Can I help you with anything else? 
a2ac5: Nope, that should be it.
b4279: It was nice talking to you. Have a great day, goodbye!

b4279: Hi Gabriel! 
a2ac5: Hi there! I ordered a workstation with overnight shipping and it hasn't showed up.  I called Fedex about it and they said it would be delivered tomorrow.  With the delayed status, they did not get info on why it was delayed and I had to call them to resolved it (I originally thought it may have been weather/snow). I asked them if I could get a refund since it will have been 5 days before I received it, and they said I had to contact you about it instead.
b4279: What is the order number please ?
a2ac5: just a moment Order #1000023384 Shipment #1000018038
b4279: I am sorry to hear that FedEx has not delivered the package. We will request for a refund in this case.  Can I update with your via email after checking with FedEx ? Is contact@gabrielhatcher.org the best email to reach you?
a2ac5: Of course! And yep, that's the best one
b4279: Thanks! I will email you regarding this shipping delay and go from there. I am sorry for the inconvenience !  Can I help you with anything else? 
a2ac5: Thank you for the help! I know this is a FedEx problem.  I don't know what they would have done with it if I hadn't called them, but they didn't send me any info like "Please contact us" or the like.

Thank you for helping!  I don't need help with anything else
b4279: You're welcome.  Hope you will get the package tomorrow !  It was nice talking to you. Have a great day, goodbye!

a2ac5: Hello. How may I help you? I am inquiring about our tax exempt status.
b4279: Hi Sarah!
a2ac5: We sent the paperwork over but I am still showing tax on our invoices.
b4279: Please give me a moment while I check for you.  Can you confirm when you sent the tax exempt certificate to us?  I'm trying to look for the email, but I'm not seeing anything from the past week
a2ac5: December 21st
b4279: Ah OK, was it from purchasing@ipconfigure.com?
a2ac5: it should have come from accounting@ipconfigure.com
b4279: It doesn't look like we received one from account@ipconfigure.com, only purchasing@ipconfigure.com.

While I can confirm we did receive the tax exempt certificate, order numbers weren't provided on the email. Joe responded back to that email requesting the order numbers for the tax exempt request, but we never got a reply back.  Would you be able to check internally to have the sender respond back with the order numbers?
a2ac5: I will take care of that. How far back can we request the adjustment for?
b4279: I believe it's for orders within 30 days. 
a2ac5: Thanks so much

b4279: Hi Chris Sure let me check for you
a2ac5: Thank you, Kyle!
b4279: PWS-504P-1R looks to be the power supply, not sure why they don't list it.  How many were you looking for? https://store.supermicro.com/500w-1u-pws-504p-1r.html It's currently out of stock, but I may be able to transfer 1 from our inventory, which could take 3-4 hours.  The newer version PWS-504P-1R2 can also be used, but you would need to replace both of the PWS-503P-1R since PWS-504P-1R2 is the newer version.  We have that one in stock https://store.supermicro.com/500w-1u-pws-504p-1r2.html
a2ac5: Perfect!  Thankyou for all the info!  I should be good to go with this info.  Thank you, Kyle!

b4279: Sounds good, let's hope so
a2ac5: SSG-6049P-E1CR36H
b4279: Ahh darn. We only have the 45 or 60 bay versions available on our eStore. Either SSG-6049P-E1CR45H or SSG-6049P-E1CR60H.

Would your customer want either of these as alternatives instead?
a2ac5: It depends on the price give me both
b4279: Let me know what components you'll need and I can provide quotes for both. The 45 bay would be the cheaper option though
a2ac5: Can you sell it like that or he has to purchase CPU, SSD and memory?
b4279: Unforunately, your customer will need to purchase it as a complete system with CPU, memory, and drives. Barebones aren't sold on our eStore 😞 
a2ac5: where can I get just the barebone?
b4279: For just the barebones, you can try checking with our Sales team or our resellers:

Sales dept: Sales-USA@supermicro.com
Tel: +1-408-503-8000

https://www.supermicro.com/en/wheretobuy

a2ac5: Hello. How may I help you? hi kyle
b4279: Hi Aaron
a2ac5: i purchased an IPMI key for my new motherboard i am trying to activate it but it does not like the PDF am i doing it wrong?
b4279: What is your order#? Nvm, I found it For H12SSL-i?
a2ac5: 7000019004 yes
b4279: Ok let me check
a2ac5: when i navigate to license activation, it shows new private key select file am i supposed to upload the PDF?
b4279: https://store.supermicro.com/software/out-of-band-oob-key-activation-guide I assume you are following this X12 section
a2ac5: i did not get a text file only a pdf
b4279: Oh I see https://store.supermicro.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/productspecs/SFT-OOB-LIC/How-to-generate-OOB-keys.pdf Did you generate the key under your account? For X12, if successful, the Product Key would be ready to download under “Generate Key” The key file is the file you need to upload when activating
a2ac5: did i not need to purchase the OOB key?
b4279: You would need to purchase the OOB license to generate a OOB key 
a2ac5: so i generated the text file using my mac address node product key stats shows SFT-OOB-LIC now is that it?
b4279: Ok In the IPMI GUI?
a2ac5: 2021-06-02 17:46:13	Redfish	Hailey	192.168.1.59	Node product key SFT-OOB-LIC was activated successfully.	others yeah in the IPMI gui
b4279: yeah you should be good You needed to generate the key file from your eStore account and upload that in IPMI
a2ac5: how do i check if there is a firmware update
b4279: Anything in Firmware management?
a2ac5: would that go through the gui?
b4279: Wait, are you taking about the BIOS firmware or IPMI firmware?
a2ac5: both
b4279: The latest BIOS firmware would be version 2.3
a2ac5: i am 2.1
b4279: Oh ok. You should be able to update remotely now since you activated OOB 
a2ac5: do i need to download it from supermicro site or can i find new firmware via IPMI
b4279: Let me double check on finding firmware via IMPI Thanks for waiting. For the IPMI firmware itself, it's under the maintenance tab and firmware update For the BIOS, you will need to download the file from the product page https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/motherboard/H12SSL-i located in "Update your bios"
 Then in IPMI maintenance, it would be under the BIOS update and you would use the file you got from the motherboard bios page
a2ac5: ok i will grab them from the site thanks again for your help
b4279: You're welcome! If you have any troubles with it, let us know Can I help you with anything else? 
a2ac5: nope should be good thanks again

b4279: I see. If you need any help with any parts you want and not showing on the configurator, please don't hesitate to come to our chat 
a2ac5: will do.. thanks again and have a great day. Hello. How may I help you? Hello, this is Mischa Baars from the Netherlands. I have a few questions about a couple of your boards. These came out of a selection: Supermicro H12SSL-NT/CT, Asrock Rack TRX40D8-2N2T, Supermicro H12SSL-NT/CT, Asrock Rack ROMED6U-2L2T, Supermicro H12SSL-NT, Supermicro H12SSL-CT. To build a computer with 16, 24, 32, 48 or 64 cores. Now, I'm also working on a new computer chip. And I found this yesterday. https://numato.com/product/aller-artix-7-fpga-board-with-m-2-interface/ Do you think your boards will work with this FPGA development board? It's actually designed for use in a laptop.
b4279: I see We actually don't know if it will work since it is not tested and validated by our lab You will need to use it at your own risk
a2ac5: Ah, yes. I understand. Maybe an educated guess? Yes or no? Or it should ... I've never used M.2 before and I don't see it as such on the boards either :)
b4279: Let me see what I can find. Please give me a moment while I check for you. 
a2ac5: No problem :)
b4279: I don't think it will work but you can check with support@supermicro.com again for the advice. 
a2ac5: Why do you think it won't work?
b4279: Our 11 the gen motherboards don't support FPGA
a2ac5: Ok, so support should be built-in?
b4279: I am not sure what you are asking ?
a2ac5: Well, you're saying FPGAs are not supported, so I was thinking about low-level code in the BIOS or something.
b4279: Not sure if that's the case since we don't have information regarding  supporting FPGA
a2ac5: I can ofcourse also ask the people of Numato. Perhaps they have more experience with the different mother boads? boards So it's more or less undocumented, but not unsupported?
b4279: It will be good to check with them
a2ac5: I will.
b4279: Can I help you with anything else? 
a2ac5: Eh, no... I suppose that was it then :) Thank you for your help.
b4279: You're welcome. Sorry can't be anymore help than that.  It was nice talking to you. Have a great day, goodbye! 
a2ac5: Same to you! Hello. How may I help you? Hello. How may I help you? I'm looking for 3 of these, says in stock but only 1. Is that correct?

a2ac5: That would be great, please do. Once I get he email I will order the all
